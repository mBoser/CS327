The first part to creating this pokemon game, we need to generate a map. My approach for this is first generating
a path using some random locations for the exits, and then connecting them in a somewhat random manner. The next 
step in the map generation process was to create the pokemart and the pokemon centers. I chose random x values 
and then found the nearest path and then do some simple validity checks to see if the space is open, then place
them attached to the path. After the buildings have been generated, the last step is to generate the biomes and
other terrain.
