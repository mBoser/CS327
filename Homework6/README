Main Functions:
    None, just the new parser.cpp file

Use: 
    **FOR CPP VERSION OF POKE USE THIS**
    make
    ./poke327

    **TO TEST THE PARSING USE THIS**
    make parser
    ./parser <filename>


For this assignment, I started with professors code from 1.05, and built off that.
I started by trying to convert to CPP but for whatever reason I was struggling with
the type casting which ended up being super easy, but since it wouldn't compile
without this conversion working, I just decided to write the parser it its own file
with its own main. After I got the parsing working by iterating through each line and
storing it in its own class variable depening on the file that was selected. I was
left with not a lot of time to do the conversion and on top of that, merge the
standalone file with the poke327 file. They both work in their own right, but I know
that we were supposed to have it work all in one, but I hope that isn't too big
of a problem :) Anyways for the cpp conversion it was actually really simple to change
to classes, pretty much replaced static struct with class. The annoying part was
doing all of the typecasts, but conveniently it pretty much tells you exactly what
to cast to and it just so happens to be on almost all of the "malloc" calls, so that
was not too bad once I got rolling. Anyways that is my 1.06 thanks for reading! :D

Known Bugs:
    Not really any bugs that are known, just that they are separate files
    and you have to comple them separately with their own args. Hopefully
    the awesome TA that grades this lets it slide ;)
