This is my simple program in C that solves all of the "knights tour" problem on a 5x5 grid. As far as I can tell
it works flawlessly printing out all 1728 solutions. Some of the core functionality is the tour function that
is called recursively to find all of the necessary paths. Some of the variables passed in were a 5x5 grid that I
used for checking if I had visited that slot, and if i had mark it as a 0, and if it was unvisited, mark it as a -1.
Another key feature was the path list, which was just a simple 1D array that kept track of the path taken to get to
the end, and if the end was reached, print out the path. This was nice because it could be changed over and over again
without having to worry about overrwrites and what not, because if it reached the end, it did what it was needed to
do and was ready to start again.
