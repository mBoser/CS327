For this assignement, I decided to utilize the professors code from assignement 1. Well my code
for the first assignement worked, it was not structured well enougth to be able to support
some of the functionality that we will need for this assignement. I added a structure to hold
the whole world map, as well as the current coordinates of the user. After editing some of the
functions from the professors code, I was then able to choose weather or not I wanted an exit
to be randomly generated, or to be dictated by its neighbors. This was a relatively simple task
if you draw it out rather than trying to visualize everything. I also implemented the probability
that the buildings would spawn, I tweaked his algorithm a little, because based on the manhattan
distance, it could possibly be 398 blocks away, which would give you a negative chance of
spawning a building. The only thing I changed was divided the -45*d by 400 instead of 200, to
account for this change in distance. This was a very satisfying project to work on and I hope this
time I can use my code from this assignement, on the next one.
