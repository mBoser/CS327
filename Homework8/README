Use: 
    make
    ./poke327


For this assignment, I started with professors code from 1.07 and built off that.
To start this assignment, I decided to go the route of each "instance" would get
its own function that would stay there, until either a decision was met, or the
user backed out with the escape key. There is far too much to go over in just
this readme so I will just say that each level of a battle, goes one deeper, and
from there, you can either go back with no penalty, or you can continue to go
deeper until the bottom of the stack is reached. Most of my work was done in io.cpp
witch is where all the io functions and helper functions reside. They all stem from
either io_battle() or io_encounter_pokemon(). To get into all the source code, start
there and then go from each call respectively. 

Known Bugs:
    Not really any bugs that are known, It should
    be explained by the UI if there is any ambiguity.
    If there are any bugs, they aren't really known I suppose.
    The only thing that may not be intended is if the
    user uses a potion or revive, it does not use a turn,
    whereas if they switch or fail an escape it uses a turn
